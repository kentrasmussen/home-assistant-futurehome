## 1.8.0 (01.07.2026)

- Expose the battery maintenance status (e.g. `replace_now`) as a diagnostic "Battery status" sensor for devices that support the `replace_*` battery events. Previously this was not surfaced at all, so a device could report a full battery level while actually needing its battery replaced.

## 1.7.0 (01.07.2026)

- Added support for the Futurehome house mode (Home/Away/Sleep/Vacation). The current mode is exposed as a `Mode` selector on the Smarthub device, updates in real time (e.g. when a Futurehome Modeswitch button is pressed), and can be changed from Home Assistant.
- Scene controllers (`scene_ctrl`, e.g. the Futurehome Modeswitch) now also expose an [`Event`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/event/) entity, so momentary button presses can trigger automations (the previous `Scene` sensor was stuck on `unknown` and could not react to repeated presses).

## 1.6.2 (16.05.2026)

- Fix invalid device_class + unit_of_measurement combinations for HA 2026.5 (#32).

## 1.6.1 (16.10.2025)

## 1.3.0 (28.09.2025)

- Use proper `light` entity for out_lvl_switch if the device type is "light", instead of generic `number` level switch (thanks @Andbli for help!).

## 1.2.1 (26.09.2025)

- Revert 'Use `light` entity for out_lvl_switch if the device type is "light"'.

## 1.2.0 (26.09.2025)
